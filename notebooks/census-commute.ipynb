    "------------------------\n",

    "The first step is determining the relevant variables and their codes.\n",
    "[Tables and variables in Excel can be found here.](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-shells.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that the variable names from the spreadsheets don't exactly match the names in the API.\n",
    "The API variables can be loaded as JSON (below), with a couple of helper methods to\n",
    "look through that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python `census` package is a thin wrapper on the Census REST API. We don't need to\n",
    "know the exact endpoints in order to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to [register for an API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) to use the API.\n",
    "If you keep your Notebook private, you can include the key in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have my key stored in a file called .env in my project root, in the format:\n",
    "`CENSUS_API_KEY=3330943536436307591747355883236309887155`\n",
    "                \n",
    "(no, that's not my real key)\n",
    "\n",
    "My basic practice is: look in the Excel sheets for likely variables, and/or ask ChatGPT for suggestions.\n",
    "Write some code to load some of this data and see what it looks like. Then pull a more\n",
    "coherent dataset together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Census data is tied to geography, from largest to smallest (roughly):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nation\n",
    "- Region\n",
    "- Division\n",
    "- State\n",
    "- County\n",
    "- Place\n",
    "- Tract\n",
    "- Block Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a fairly large geography to start with because it will be faster and the results will\n",
    "be smaller. Include `NAME` AND `GEO_ID` in the query so you can see what you're looking at.\n",
    "We can use `GEO_ID` later to join in geospatial data (e.g. `GeoDataFrame`).\n"
